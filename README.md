Join me on this virtual adventure as i investigate the fascinating field of computer science at the University of Ghana, where learning and creativity collide. Welcome to the official website of the University of Ghana, dedicated to providing a vibrant online environment for the expanding computer science community. As this website's designer, my goal is to create a digital hub that connects instructors, enthusiasts, and students with ease. Discover the many facets of exceptional academic achievement, cutting-edge research, and the exciting activities that are forming our department.

I took on a project to design the University of Ghana Computer Science Department website, which involved learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub. By using these tools, I was able to acquire practical knowledge about web development and version control. Building this website served as my classroom, where challenges shaped my understanding and problem-solving led to the development of my skills. This project does not represent a work of mastery, but rather a deep learning experience that demonstrated my dedication to development and flexibility. Come explore this dynamic website, which is a testament to the transformative power of practical computer science education.


# Here are detailed instructions on how to clone and set up a project from a GitHub repository:
1. Fork the Repository:
Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page.
This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
2. Clone Your Forked Repository:
On your forked repository page, click the "Code" button.
Copy the HTTPS or SSH URL (depending on your preference).
Open your terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the cd command.
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/directory
Run the following command to clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <https://github.com/bakorx/11279787_DCIT205.git>
3. Navigate to the Cloned Directory:
bash
Copy code
cd repository-name
4. Add the Original Repository as a Remote:
This step allows you to keep your fork updated with changes from the original repository.
bash
Copy code
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bakorx/11279787_DCIT205.git
5. Create a Branch:
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature-branch
Replace "feature-branch" with a descriptive branch name related to the changes you plan to make.

6. Make Changes:
Make your desired changes to the project files. Add, modify, or delete files as needed.

7. Commit Changes:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message"
8. Push Changes to Your Fork:
bash
Copy code
git push origin feature-branch
9. Create a Pull Request:
Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
Click the "New Pull Request" button.
Choose the base repository and branch where you want to merge your changes.
Write a meaningful title and description for your pull request.
Click on the "Create Pull Request" button.
Your pull request is now submitted. It will be reviewed by the repository owner or maintainers. If changes are requested, make the updates locally, commit them, and push again to the same branch. The pull request will automatically update.

These steps cover the basic process of cloning a repository, making changes, and creating a pull request. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific project or repository instructions.
