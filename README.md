I took on a project to design the University of Ghana Computer Science Department website, which involved learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and GitHub. By using these tools, I was able to acquire practical knowledge about web development and version control. Building this website served as my classroom, where challenges shaped my understanding and problem-solving led to the development of my skills. This project does not represent a work of mastery, but rather a deep learning experience that demonstrated my dedication to development and flexibility. Come explore this dynamic website, which is a testament to the transformative power of practical computer science education.
